#+title: Minecraft!!!!

I'm currently running 3 servers, all behind a proxy (velocity).

* Lobby (?)
I say this is a lobby, but it's probably gonna be a regular vanilla survival
server for my friends :3
* SMP
It's my private server, and it's probably ever gonna get one or two more people
whitelisted.
* Cobblemon
made for a friend. it was not that hard tbh...
