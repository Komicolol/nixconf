#+author: cheeseburger om

- Hours of configs, just to use it on 3 (+1) machines :sob:

have fun (?) looking at this mess lmao

** Information
this is bc i know i'll forget what some options are and it might get too complicated for me

*** hosts
- amogus = my thinkpad t14 1st gen laptop
- android = my motorola phone and samsung tablet (not working and i don't wanna fix it.)
- lapserver1 = old ass laptop that i'll use as a server because i'm bored
- vm1 = a vm just to test server configs


*** User Options
Default setting btw
- Hyprland - ~hyprwm.enable = false~
- Xfce4 - ~xfceDE.enable = false~
- Terminal Stuff - ~terminal.enable = false~
- Gaming - ~gaming.enable = false~
- DevStuff - ~devstuff.enable = false~
- VMs - ~vmthings.enable = false~
- Other Packages - ~regularstuff.enable = false~

*** Setting Options
I should probably do that, huh? (everything is needed...)

**** Server Options (this is pretty dumb tbh)
I haven't set these up at ALL.
 - Minecraft - ~minecraftTs.enable = false~
 - Jellyfin - ~jellything.enable = false~
 - Storage - ~ineedstorage.enable = false~
 - Docker - ~dockerContainer.enable = false~ (might just add this to server module directly)
 - sshd - ~sshdstuff.enable = false~
