#+title: My Nix Confing
#+author: cheeseburger om

A Nix configuration of all time, and i hope it won't spiral out of control /too/ quickly. hopefully.

** Information
this is bc i know i'll forget what some options are and it might get too complicated for me

*** hosts
- amogus = my thinkpad t14 1st gen laptop
- android = my motorola phone and samsung tablet (not working and i don't wanna fix it.)
- lapserver1 = old ass laptop that i'll use as a server because i'm bored
- vm1 = a vm just to test server configs

*** Options
me realising that all it's better to have it in different files:
- [[./system/README.org][System Options]]
- [[./user/README.org][User Options]]
- [[./system/server/README.org][System Options]]

** If you want to use my config..
Don't. I'm just joking, go copy a template of mine and insert your hardware config file. Look into the options above just to see what you can use.
*** CHANGE THIS FILE SPECIFICALLY BTWWWW
- [[./system/users/default.nix][User Configuration]] - *CHANGE PUB SSH KEY AND MAYBE REMOVE PASSWORD FILES IDKKK*

*** Templates
- [[./hosts/templates/desktop/configuration.nix][Desktop Template]]
- [[./hosts/templates/server/configuration.nix][Server Template]]

Just a heads up, this is a personal config of mine and is made just for me. So some things might not work for some people, but whatever. Oh, and you should have some knowledge of Nix before using this.

/oh why even make this section then/ I don't wanna do school work, so I needed to so something to procrastinate ok :sob:

** Why NixOS?
Because I was watching Nix propaganda (No Boilerplate), and since I was setting a new laptop I thought it'd be a waste to not try it out. Now look at where I'm at...
